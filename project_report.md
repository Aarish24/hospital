## Theory

### Database Design Principles

The Hospital Management System is built on a robust relational database model that adheres to established database design principles and best practices. The theoretical foundation of the database design includes:

1. **Entity-Relationship Model**: 
   - The system employs a comprehensive ER model to represent real-world entities (patients, doctors, rooms) and their complex interrelationships
   - Entity types are carefully identified based on domain analysis of hospital operations
   - Attributes are assigned to appropriate entities with proper data types and constraints
   - Relationships between entities are classified as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many
   - Cardinality and participation constraints are explicitly defined to enforce business rules
   - The ER model serves as the conceptual blueprint for the physical database implementation

2. **Normalization Techniques**:
   - First Normal Form (1NF): Eliminates repeating groups by ensuring atomic values in all columns
   - Second Normal Form (2NF): Removes partial dependencies by ensuring all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key
   - Third Normal Form (3NF): Eliminates transitive dependencies by ensuring non-key attributes depend only on the primary key
   - Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): Applied to certain tables to address anomalies not resolved by 3NF
   - The normalized schema minimizes data redundancy, improves update efficiency, and enhances data integrity

3. **Referential Integrity**:
   - Foreign key constraints are implemented to maintain consistency between related tables
   - Cascading updates and deletes are carefully configured based on business requirements
   - Constraint enforcement ensures that no orphaned records can exist in the database
   - Referential actions (CASCADE, SET NULL, RESTRICT) are defined based on domain-specific rules
   - Integrity constraints protect against data inconsistencies during concurrent operations

4. **Indexing Strategy**:
   - Primary keys are automatically indexed for efficient record retrieval
   - Secondary indexes are created on frequently queried columns to optimize search operations
   - Composite indexes support multi-column query patterns
   - Indexing strategy balances query performance with update overhead
   - Index selection is based on query analysis and performance profiling

5. **Transaction Management**:
   - ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) are enforced for all database operations
   - Transaction boundaries are defined to ensure logical units of work
   - Concurrency control mechanisms prevent data corruption during simultaneous access
   - Isolation levels are configured to balance consistency with performance
   - Error handling includes transaction rollback capabilities to maintain database integrity
